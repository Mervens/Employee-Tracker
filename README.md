## Description  
This assignment was to use SQL to create the database for a collection of Employees and their roles. The app takes in information from the seeds and repeats it once it has been initialized in node.


## How It Works  

**Install the needed packages in the terminal using:**

`npm install`

**Then run this in the terminal:**

`node tracker.js`

## Example!
